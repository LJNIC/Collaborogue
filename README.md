#Collaborogue

Collaborogue is a collaborative roguelike game/engine written in Lua by Matthew Blanchard & Rynelf. It is highly extensible, and includes plenty of items and creatures as examples. The project is currently on hold. It uses a custom version of ROTLove that works with the most recent version of LOVE.
